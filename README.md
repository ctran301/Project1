We put together this presentation to help others understand how we thought a multi-billion dollar corporation like Starbucks would seek to expand into different locations. At the start of the project, we wanted to answer these basic questions:

    -As a popular domestic brand, is Starbucks prevalent across the entire United States?
    -Does Starbucks offer the same appeal globally?
    -Are we able to find trends for existing locations using basic census data?
    -Are we able to determine where a new Starbucks location may open in Greater Orlando?
    
 Utilizing Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Python, we pulled income and zipcode data from Starbucks and Census APIs. We then cleaned the data and applied the data to the local Greater Orlando area. We then visualized our data using Matplotlib. Our final product is under the "Starbucks Presentation Final" PowerPoint file. Enjoy!
